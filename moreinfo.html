            <h2>Black Holes</h2>
            <p class="par"> 
                The process of forming a black hole begins when a massive star explodes in a supernova, throwing its outer layers into space. What remains <br>
                is the core, which collapses into a tiny, incredibly dense point called a singularity. This singularity is surrounded by an invisible boundary known<br>
                  as the event horizon, which marks the point of no return; anything that crosses this boundary is pulled into the black hole and cannot escape.<br>
                 <br>
                Despite their power and influence in the universe, black holes are very hard to see. Astronomers canâ€™t directly observe them because they do not <br>
                emit light. Instead, they look for the effects of black holes on nearby stars and gas. By studying how stars move around them or how they heat up <br>
                as they fall in, scientists gather clues about these mysterious objects. Black holes remain one of the most intriguing subjects in astronomy, raising <br>
                many questions about the nature of space and time.
